# Kakarlapudi Akhil's GitHub

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am passionate about Generative AI and have a deep interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This repository showcases my work and contributions in various areas of AI, deep learning, and NLP. Below is a summary of the skills and technologies I specialize in:

## ðŸ§  Skills & Expertise

### 1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - **One-Hot Encoding**: Encoding text data into binary vectors for machine learning models.
   - **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Text representation that focuses on word frequency without considering word order.
   - **TF-IDF**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, a statistical measure to evaluate how important a word is to a document.
   - **Word2Vec & AvgWord2Vec**: Word embeddings to represent words in a continuous vector space based on their semantic meaning.

### 2. **Deep Learning & Neural Networks**
   - **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: Building and training multi-layered neural networks.
   - **Forward Propagation**: The process of passing data through the network layers.
   - **Backward Propagation**: The process of updating weights in a network using gradient descent.
   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Handling sequence data with feedback loops, useful for time series and language modeling.
   - **LSTM RNN (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A type of RNN designed to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data.
   - **GRU RNN (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: A simplified version of LSTM with fewer parameters.
   - **Bidirectional LSTM**: A variation of LSTM that processes data in both forward and backward directions.
   - **Encoder-Decoder & Attention Mechanism**: Used in sequence-to-sequence models, especially for tasks like machine translation.
   - **Transformers**: State-of-the-art architecture for NLP, including models like BERT, GPT, and T5.

### 3. **Generative AI**
   - **Transformers & Attention Mechanisms**: Mastery over architectures that enable models to generate high-quality text and perform other generative tasks.
   - **Langchain**: A framework for building applications with language models and integrating with other components.

### 4. **Vector Databases**
   - **Chroma**: A vector database for building and managing embeddings.
   - **FAISS DB**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

### 5. **Hugging Face**
   - Proficient in using **Hugging Face Transformers** for fine-tuning and deploying state-of-the-art NLP models, such as BERT, GPT, and T5.
   - Familiar with Hugging Face datasets and models to streamline AI workflows and implement solutions quickly.

## ðŸš€ Current Projects

I am continuously working on enhancing my skills and exploring new AI techniques. Below are some of my ongoing or completed projects:
