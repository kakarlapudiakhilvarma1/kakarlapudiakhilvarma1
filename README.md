Kakarlapudi Akhil's GitHub
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Kakarlapudi Akhil, a passionate AI enthusiast and a specialist in Natural Language Processing (NLP), deep learning, and Generative models. I love exploring the intersection of technology and human language, and I am always looking to learn, share, and collaborate on innovative AI projects.

ðŸš€ About Me
I am deeply interested in the applications of Generative AI, particularly in the fields of NLP, deep learning, and machine learning. With hands-on experience in various NLP techniques and neural network architectures, I aim to build intelligent systems that can understand, generate, and transform human language.

Some of the topics I focus on include:

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
One-hot Encoding, Bag of Words, TF-IDF
Word2Vec, AvgWord2Vec
Transformers, BERT, GPT-based models
Sequence-to-sequence models, Encoder-Decoder, Attention mechanisms
Deep Learning Architectures
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTM, GRU
Multi-Layered Neural Networks: Forward & Backpropagation
Bidirectional LSTM Networks
Vector Databases
Chroma DB, Faiss DB
Generative AI Frameworks
HuggingFace Transformers
Langchain for building applications
ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools
Languages: Python, SQL, TensorFlow, PyTorch
Libraries/Frameworks: HuggingFace, NLTK, SpaCy, Langchain, OpenAI API
Vector Databases: Chroma, FAISS
Other Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Colab, Git, Docker
ðŸ”¥ Projects
Here are some of the cool projects I've worked on that you can explore:

1. Text Generation with GPT-2 & GPT-3
Built an interactive web app using GPT-2 and GPT-3 to generate text and responses based on user input.
Utilized HuggingFaceâ€™s Transformers library for seamless integration with OpenAI models.
2. NLP Sentiment Analysis Pipeline
Created an NLP-based sentiment analysis pipeline using traditional techniques (TF-IDF) and modern transformer models (BERT).
Implemented a Flask web app to deploy the model and provide real-time predictions.
3. Question Answering System with Transformers
Developed a question-answering system powered by a fine-tuned BERT model.
Integrated it with a vector database for efficient information retrieval.
4. Langchain Integration for Conversational AI
Built a conversational AI app using Langchain to create custom workflows and pipelines for integrating multiple AI services.
Deployed the app with a simple user interface for testing and feedback collection.
5. FAISS-Based Search Engine
Implemented a content-based search engine with FAISS for fast nearest neighbor search and retrieval from large text corpora.
Combined FAISS with pre-trained word embeddings to improve the quality of search results.
